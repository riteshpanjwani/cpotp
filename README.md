# cpotp
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/cpotp.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cpotp)

Command line tool to copy the latest OTP received in the connected Android device to the clipboard.

## Why?
Simply because I don't want to pickup my phone, open the SMS app, remember the OTP, and then enter it.

Now you might say, haven't you heard about https://messages.google.com? Well, that's what is being used in the package. Selenium Chrome driver automates this process.

## Prerequisite
- Python >= 3.6
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/) / [Chromium](https://download-chromium.appspot.com/) / [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) / [Microsoft Edge Dev for Linux](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/)
- [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) (if you're on Linux)
- Android device

## Installation

### Install cpotp

cpotp can be installed using pip

```
pip install cpotp
```

or install it from the source

```
git clone https://github.com/riteshpanjwani/cpotp.git
cd cpotp
python setup.py install
```

### Install xclip (Linux only)

If you are using any fairly recent Debian Linux-based OS:

```
sudo apt install xclip
```

else, you can install it directly from the source:

```
git clone https://github.com/astrand/xclip.git
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make install
```
Verify that it installed:

```
man xclip
```

### Set an environment variable
Next, you need to set an environment variable called CHROME_USER_DATA_DIR, in Chrome/Edge/Chromium browser new tab
```
chrome://version
```

and set this environment variable to path given in "Profile Path"
except the "/Default" part. For example:
```
export CHROME_USER_DATA_DIR=/home/<username>/.config/google-chrome
```
Selenium will create a Chrome user profile called "cpotp" in this directory.

## Usage

Note: the following command downloads the following files on the first run:
- appropriate [Chromium drivers](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) using [pyderman](https://pypi.org/project/pyderman/)
- [NLTK punkt package](https://www.nltk.org/data.html) to [tokenize](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tokenization-1.html) the SMS

Close any instance of https://messages.google.com and fire up a terminal / command prompt and run:

```
cpotp
```

It will start a Chrome window which will be minimized, on the first run, restore the window, scan the QR code using your Messages app on the phone and pair it, on the subsequent runs, window need not be restored.
